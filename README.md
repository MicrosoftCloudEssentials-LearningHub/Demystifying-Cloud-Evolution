## History → Cloud → Azure 

> `Why There’s Not Enough Quota/Capacity for Some Cloud Services in Some Regions?`

> 1. **Physical Hardware Limits**:
>     - Each cloud region is made up of physical data centers (“Availability Zones”) with finite amounts of servers, storage, and network hardware.
>     - Newer hardware (like GPUs or specialized AI accelerators) or high-demand VM types may be deployed in limited quantities, especially in smaller or newer regions.
> 2. **High Regional Demand**:
>     - Popular regions (e.g., “East US”, “West Europe”) can experience surges in demand, especially for trendy services (e.g., AI, GPUs, large VM sizes).
>     - Capacity is often allocated on a first-come, first-served basis; sudden spikes (product launches, AI workloads, seasonal trends) can exhaust available resources.
> 3. **Quota as a Control Mechanism**:
>    - Cloud providers set default quotas (“service limits”) per subscription to prevent accidental overspending and to protect the underlying infrastructure from noisy-neighbor effects.
>    - Quotas help manage risk, avoid abuse, and ensure fair access for all tenants.
> 4. **Supply Chain and Energy Constraints**:
>    - Hardware supply can be delayed due to global supply chain issues, and energy constraints (grid limits, sustainability targets) can cap regional expansion.
>    - Highly sustainable regions may have stricter power/capacity planning to meet carbon goals.
> 5. **Regulatory and Compliance Restrictions**: Some services are only available in specific regions due to regulatory, data residency, or export control reasons.

### Early Computing Era (1801-1843)

> The early computing era established fundamental concepts still used today:
>  - Program storage separate from computation mechanism
>  - The notion of a general-purpose machine that can be programmed for different tasks
>  - Separation of data and instructions
>  - Sequential execution of operations

<details>
  <summary><b>Jacquard Loom (1801)</b></summary>

> Introduced a system of `punched cards` to control the weaving of complex textile patterns. Each card represented a row of the design, and holes in the card determined which warp threads were lifted.  

- **Joseph Marie Jacquard**: Created programmable textile looms that revolutionized the silk industry
- **Technical significance**: Demonstrated storing instructions as physical media; inspired later computing pioneers
  - **Binary Encoding**: Presence or absence of a hole acted as a binary signal (on/off), a precursor to digital logic.
  - **Sequential Control**: Cards were fed in sequence, allowing the loom to execute a stored program of instructions.
  - **Modularity**: Patterns could be changed by swapping card sets, introducing the concept of **programmability**.
  - **Significance**:
    - Demonstrated **data-driven automation**, instructions stored on physical media rather than hardwired mechanisms.
    - Influenced early computing pioneers like **Charles Babbage**, who adopted the punched card concept for the Analytical Engine.
- **Legacy**: Direct ancestor to punch card computing systems used through the 1970s
  - Direct ancestor of **punch card computing systems** used in tabulating machines (Hollerith, IBM) and early digital computers through the 1970s.
  - Established the principle of **separating hardware from instructions**, foundational for modern computing.

  <summary><b>Analytical Engine (1837)</b></summary>

- **Inventor**: Charles Babbage, an English mathematician and engineer, often called the `father of the computer`. Although the machine was never completed during his lifetime, his design laid the foundation for modern computing.
- **Historical Context**: Conceived in 1837 as an evolution of Babbage’s earlier Difference Engine, the Analytical Engine was designed during the Industrial Revolution, when mechanical engineering was advancing rapidly.
- **Technical Features**:
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Known as the `mill`, it could perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  - **Memory**: Called the `store`, it could hold up to 1,000 numbers of 40 digits each.
  - **Input/Output**: Planned to use punched cards for input (inspired by Jacquard looms) and a printer for output, along with a curve plotter and bell.
  - **Control Flow**: Included conditional branching and loops, making it Turing-complete in concept.
- **Architecture**:
  - **Separation of Components**: Distinguished between the `store` (memory) and the `mill` (processor), a principle still used in modern von Neumann architecture.
  - **Programmability**: Programs were to be fed via punched cards, allowing general-purpose computation rather than a single fixed task.
- **Significance**:
  - First complete design for a `general-purpose programmable computing device`.
  - Influenced later pioneers like Ada Lovelace, who wrote what is considered the first algorithm intended for a machine.
  - Although never built due to technological and financial limitations, its conceptual design anticipated key elements of modern computers.
- **Legacy**:
  - Demonstrated the feasibility of automated computation.
  - Inspired future generations of computer scientists and engineers, bridging the gap between mechanical calculation and electronic computing.

### Formal Foundations (1936-1945)

> This era formalized computing theory and produced the first working electronic computers:
>   - Proved the theoretical basis and limits of computation
>   - Transition from mechanical to electrical computing (1000x speedup)
>   - Established binary digital representation as the foundation for modern computers
>   - Created both the theory and practical implementations of programmable machines

<details>
  <summary><b>Turing Machine (1936)</b></summary>

- **Alan Turing**: British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst who formalized the concept of algorithm and computation, laying the foundation for theoretical computer science.
- **Technical Significance**: Introduced the Turing Machine model in 1936, defining the limits of what can be computed. Proved that some problems are undecidable, such as the Halting Problem, establishing fundamental boundaries of computability.
- **Key Concepts**: 
    - Universal Turing Machine: A theoretical machine capable of simulating any other Turing machine, forming the basis for the concept of general-purpose computers.
    - Halting Problem: Demonstrated that no algorithm can determine, for all possible programs and inputs, whether the program will eventually halt or run forever.
        - Perfect program verification is impossible
        - No compiler can detect all infinite loops
        - No antivirus can detect all malware
        - No static analysis tool can find all bugs
    - Computability: Formalized the notion of effectively calculable functions, aligning with Church’s lambda calculus in the Church–Turing thesis.
- **Architecture**: An abstract machine consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells, a read/write head that moves left or right, and a finite set of states with transition rules. This model captures the essence of sequential computation.
- **Enigma Cipher Context**: The Enigma cipher was an electro-mechanical rotor machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II to encrypt military communications. Its complex system of rotating wheels and plugboard connections produced a vast number of possible settings, making the cipher extremely difficult to break without knowledge of the daily key. The security of Enigma was believed to be unbreakable at the time, and its use was central to German military strategy.
- **Evolution of the Machine**: Enigma and Bombe: During World War II, Turing applied his theoretical insights to the practical problem of breaking the Enigma cipher. He designed the electromechanical Bombe machine, which automated the process of testing Enigma settings, representing a significant step from theoretical computation to real-world cryptanalytic machinery.
- **Impact Beyond Theory**: 
    - Cryptanalysis: Played a key role in breaking the Enigma cipher during World War II, significantly influencing the outcome of the war.
    - Artificial Intelligence: Proposed the Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence, sparking decades of research in AI.
    - Modern Computing: His theoretical work underpins the design of compilers, interpreters, and the concept of stored-program computers.
- **Legacy**: Regarded as one of the fathers of computer science. The Turing Award, often called the `Nobel Prize of Computing`, is named in his honor.

> The Halting Problem doesn't mean we can't analyze programs at all, it just proves we can't have a universal algorithm that works for all possible programs. This fundamental limitation shapes how we approach:
>  - Software testing (why we need multiple approaches)
>  - Formal verification (why we use constrained languages)
>  - Programming language design (why some features are restricted)
>  - Compiler optimization (why certain analyses are heuristic)

### PC & Internet Revolution (1950s-1990)

> This era democratized computing and built the Internet infrastructure:
>   - Transition from batch processing to interactive computing
>   - Evolution from centralized to distributed systems
>   - Development of layered network protocols that enabled global connectivity
>   - Creation of standards that allowed interoperability between systems from different vendors

> Mental model: `CPU sets up the plan; the device moves the bytes; the CPU gets a doorbell when it’s done.`

> DMA (Direct Memory Access) lets devices read/write RAM without the CPU copying each byte. The CPU prepares a small descriptor (buffer address/length), the device’s DMA engine `bus‑masters` the transfer, then raises an interrupt on completion. This frees CPU cycles, reduces cache pollution, and improves throughput. By contrast, programmed I/O makes the CPU loop over device registers to move data, slow and CPU‑bound.
>
> How Channel I/O maps: mainframes used dedicated I/O processors (`channels`) that executed “channel programs” to walk buffers, handle retries, and signal the host, conceptually like modern DMA engines plus queue descriptors.
>
> - RX: Receive (ingress) - data coming into the host/device
> - TX: Transmit (egress) - data going out from the host/device
>   
> Modern descendants:
> - NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express): submission/completion queues in memory; SSDs DMA payloads directly to host buffers.
> - NICs (Network Interface Cards): RX/TX rings with scatter, gather DMA; RDMA can place bytes straight into app memory.
> - SR‑IOV ( Single Root I/O Virtualization): splits a NIC into virtual functions so VMs/containers get fast, isolated DMA queues.

<details>
  <summary><b>Mainframes (1950s)</b></summary>

- **IBM System/360 (1964)**: First family of compatible computers with different performance levels
- **Technical features**: Standardized instruction set architecture across product line
- **Impact**: Established the concept of a computer "architecture" independent of implementation
- **Business model**: Centralized computing with terminals; time-sharing systems
- Architectural hallmarks:
  - Standardized ISA (nstruction Set Architecture) across models: culminates in IBM System/360 (1964), the first broad `family` with binary compatibility.
  - 8‑bit byte and 32‑bit word conventions; EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code IBM character encoding) for character encoding.
  - Privilege rings and storage protection keys; separation of problem state vs supervisor state.
  - Channel I/O: offloads device control to `channels` and control units. Host builds a channel program (descriptors), then DMA proceeds asynchronously with interrupts on completion/error.
  - Reliability/availability/serviceability (RAS) as design goals: parity/ECC (Error-Correcting Code, memory that detects/corrects bit errors, typically single-bit) memory, hot‑swap field‑replaceable units, error logging.
- Operating systems and usage:
  - OS/360 (MFT/MVT) → job control (JCL), batch queues; later TSO for interactive use.
  - Time‑sharing lineage (CTSS, MULTICS) influences conversational use; virtualization CP‑67/VM‑370 introduces full‑system virtualization (multiple OSes concurrently).
  - Spooling: decouples slow devices (printers, card readers) via disk queues.
- Performance features:
  - Pipelining and lookahead units in high‑end models (e.g., S/360 Model 91).
  - Floating‑point units and decimal arithmetic for commercial workloads.
  - Large memory for the era (hundreds of KB to MB), and I/O throughput prioritized over single‑thread latency.
- Business/operational model:
  - Centralized compute with 3270 terminals; chargeback based on CPU seconds, I/O counts, storage used.
  - Leasing/service contracts; upgrade path within the same ISA reduces software rewrite costs.

> Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (`ARPA`; later `DARPA`).
> Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (U.S. Department of Defense R&D agency)

> Three enduring ideas born here: packet switching, end‑to‑end principle, and layered protocols—precursors to modern SDN (Software-Defined Networking) overlays and service meshes.

- **Key people**: Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Leonard Kleinrock, J.C.R. Licklider
- **Technical innovations**: Packet switching, distributed network without central control
- **Protocols**: Network Control Program (NCP), later TCP/IP (1983)

- Physical and node design:
  - Backbone: 50 kbps leased lines linking Interface Message Processors (IMPs) built on ruggedized minicomputers.
  - Host–IMP interface: 1822 protocol; hosts connected via a standard hardware/driver contract.
- Packet switching and reliability:
  - Store‑and‑forward switching with small fixed‑size packets; per‑link queues, hop‑by‑hop retransmission.
  - Early distance‑vector style routing; later refinements reduce count‑to‑infinity and instability.
- Host protocols and “flag day”:
  - NCP (Network Control Program) handles connections and flow control for early hosts.
  - Jan 1, 1983: “flag day” migration to TCP/IP (IP for internetworking, TCP for reliable byte streams, UDP for datagrams).
- Naming and scaling: Manual HOSTS.TXT replaced by hierarchical, delegated naming (DNS, 1983), enabling global scale and caching.
- Growth path: From 4 initial nodes (UCLA, SRI, UCSB, Utah) to dozens, then interconnection with other networks (NSFNET), leading to today’s multi‑AS Internet with BGP policy routing.

  <summary><b>Intel 4004 (1971)</b></summary>

> Constraints (4‑bit ALU, tiny stack) drove tight, loop‑unrolled code and table‑driven arithmetic—early examples of co‑design between software and silicon limits.

- **Federico Faggin, Ted Hoff, Stanley Mazor**: Designers of the first commercial microprocessor
- **Technical specifications**: 2,300 transistors, 4-bit CPU, 740 kHz clock speed
- **Process technology**: 10μm silicon gate technology
- **Impact**: Began the trend of increasing integration that continues with today's processors
- Micro‑architecture:
  - 4‑bit ALU; ~2,300 transistors; max clock ~740 kHz on 10 μm silicon‑gate PMOS.
  - Harvard‑like separation: program ROM (4001) vs data RAM (4002); 4003 shift registers for I/O.
  - 12‑bit program counter (addressing up to 4 KB of program space).
  - Register file: sixteen 4‑bit registers addressable as eight 8‑bit pairs.
  - Call/return: 3‑level hardware return‑address stack.
- Instruction set and data formats:
  - ~46 instructions; 8‑bit and 16‑bit op formats; decimal (BCD) oriented operations for calculators.
  - No native hardware multiply/divide; implemented via routines.
- System design:
  - Multiplexed buses and minimal pins reduce package cost.
  - Typical application: desktop calculators (e.g., Busicom), controllers.
- Impact: Demonstrates feasibility of general‑purpose CPUs on a single chip, catalyzing the 8008/8080 → x86 line and the broader microprocessor ecosystem.

  <summary><b>IBM PC (1981) / DNS (1983)</b></summary>

> The PC’s open bus/BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and DNS’s hierarchical delegation are both `open interfaces` that unlocked third‑party ecosystems—key to later cloud modularity.


- **IBM PC**: Open architecture led to clone market and standardization
- **DNS**: Paul Mockapetris designed system to map names to IP addresses
- **Technical significance**: DNS enabled scaling the Internet beyond manual address tables
- IBM PC technicals:
  - CPU: Intel 8088 (16‑bit internal, 8‑bit external bus) @ 4.77 MHz; 8259 PIC, 8237 DMA, 8253 PIT peripherals.
  - Bus/expansion: 8‑bit ISA slots; later AT adds 16‑bit ISA.
  - Memory map: “conventional” 640 KB limit with upper area reserved for ROM/IO (the classic 640K barrier).
  - Firmware: BIOS provides device services; bootstraps DOS (PC‑DOS/MS‑DOS).
  - Openness: Published schematics and BIOS interfaces enabled clone market; clean‑room BIOS implementations (e.g., Compaq) standardized compatibility.
- DNS technicals:
  - Hierarchical distributed database: root → TLDs → domains; delegation via NS records.
  - Resource records: A/AAAA, NS, SOA, MX, CNAME, PTR, TXT etc.
  - Operation: UDP/53 for queries (TCP for zone transfers/large responses); caching with TTL to dampen load.
  - Scales beyond HOSTS.TXT by decentralizing authority and leveraging caching resolvers.

- **Tim Berners-Lee**: Created HTTP, HTML, and the first browser while at CERN

> Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (historic name); now Organisation européenne pour la recherche nucléaire → `European Organization for Nuclear Research.`

- **Technical components**: URLs, HTTP protocol, HTML markup language
- **Architecture**: Client-server model with stateless requests
- Protocol and format stack:
  - URLs/URIs specify resource identity; HTTP provides request/response; HTML provides hypertext rendering.
  - HTTP/0.9 → 1.0/1.1 add headers, caching controls, persistent connections, and proxies; later TLS adds transport security.
- Architecture:
  - Stateless, client–server model; scalability via horizontal replication behind load balancers and caching (CDNs, proxy caches).
  - Dynamic content arrives with CGI, then application servers; cookies (mid‑1990s) introduce session state atop stateless HTTP.
- Developer model:
  - From static pages to 3‑tier apps (web server, app server, database).
  - REST patterns later popularize resource‑oriented APIs over HTTP verbs and status codes.

### Cloud Computing Era (1990s-2010)

> This era transformed computing from owned assets to utility services:
>   - Decoupled physical hardware from logical resources
>   - Introduced elastic capacity and consumption-based pricing
>   - Created API-driven infrastructure enabling infrastructure-as-code (IaC)
>   - Shifted capital expenses to operational expenses
>   - Established global regions with distributed reliability

<details>
  <summary><b>Virtualization (1990s-2000s)</b></summary>

> SR‑IOV and modern vSwitch offloads cut CPU cycles per packet—crucial for data‑plane efficiency in dense fleets.

- **VMware (founded 1998)**: Commercialized x86 virtualization
- **Technical innovations**: Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs), hardware-assisted virtualization (Intel VT-x, AMD-V)
- **Benefits**: Server consolidation, workload isolation, snapshot/migration capabilities
- **Enabling technologies**: Trap-and-emulate, binary translation, paravirtualization
- Hypervisor techniques:
  - Binary translation and para‑virtualization (pre‑VT‑x/AMD‑V) to handle sensitive instructions; later hardware assist enables type‑1 hypervisors at scale.
  - Memory virtualization: shadow page tables → EPT/NPT; ballooning for overcommit; copy‑on‑write snapshots.
  - I/O virtualization: emulated devices → para‑virtual drivers (virtio) → SR‑IOV for near‑native NIC performance.
- Operational primitives:
  - Live migration (pre‑copy/post‑copy), snapshots, templates (“golden images”), high availability restarts.
  - Resource scheduling across clusters with anti‑affinity and admission control.
- Outcomes: Higher utilization, better isolation, faster provisioning—the substrate for cloud multi‑tenancy.

  <summary><b>AWS EC2/S3 (2006)</b></summary>

> `Infrastructure as API`: declare topology (instances, networks, volumes, buckets) and desired counts; the control plane validates and places; the data plane carries packets/IO. This blueprint is echoed across all major clouds.

- **Key people**: Andy Jassy (AWS CEO), Werner Vogels (CTO)
- **Technical innovations**: API-driven infrastructure, pay-per-use model
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant infrastructure, virtualization at scale
- **Impact**: Fundamentally changed IT procurement and operations models
- Control vs data planes:
  - Control plane (APIs): instance/volume/image lifecycle, placement, health, and inventory; account‑scoped policy and quotas; idempotent create/update with request tokens.
  - Data plane (packet/IO paths): hypervisor isolation + virtual NIC/block devices move bytes; separate from control to keep runtime traffic flowing during control-plane events.
- Compute isolation and lifecycle:
  - Early EC2 ran Xen (paravirt → HVM); later generations use Nitro (dedicated hardware cards offloading network/storage and minimizing host attack surface) on KVM.
  - CPU/mem isolation via VT‑x/AMD‑V + IOMMU; per‑tenant vNIC/vBlock devices; DMA guarded by IOMMU.
  - Instance states: pending → running → {stopping|stopped} → {shutting‑down|terminated}; API idempotency and eventual consistency on reads.
  - Boot/user‑data: 169.254.169.254 metadata; user‑data passed to cloud‑init for early config.
- Images and block storage:
  - AMI: root snapshot + metadata (virtualization type, device mapping); older AKI/ARI (kernel/ramdisk) images existed initially.
  - EBS (network block storage): attach/detach over network; snapshots are incremental, copy‑on‑write; volume types trade latency vs IOPS throughput.
  - Instance store: ephemeral NVMe/SATA directly on host, very fast but non‑persistent.
- Networking primitives:
  - EC2‑Classic (initial) then VPC (virtual private clouds) with subnets, route tables, NAT, NACLs; security groups are stateful firewalls at the instance ENI.
  - Elastic IPs, ENIs (multi‑NIC), Placement Groups (latency/bandwidth aware), and later SR‑IOV/ENA for high PPS/low jitter.
- Elastic primitives (autoscale/load):
  - Auto Scaling Groups (ASG): desired/min/max size; policies based on CloudWatch (CPU, RPS, Q length); launch templates/configs define AMI + instance type.
  - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB/ALB/NLB): spreads traffic across instances/AZs; health checks drive replace/heal loops.
- S3 object storage model:
  - Buckets (per region) with a flat key namespace; `folders` are prefix conventions.
  - Objects are immutable; writes create new versions if versioning is enabled; range GETs and multipart upload for large objects.
  - Consistency: originally eventual for overwrite/list; later strong read‑after‑write (not in the 2006 launch).
  - Durability/availability: multi‑AZ replication in a region targeting `11 nines` durability; storage classes + lifecycle policies for cost/latency trade‑offs.
  - Access: signed REST/HTTP APIs, pre‑signed URLs, bucket policies/IAM; optional server‑side encryption and KMS integration.
- Reliability and economics:
  - Regions → Availability Zones (independent power/network); fault domains constrain placement and replication.
  - Pay‑as‑you‑go; later options add Reserved/Spot/ Savings instruments; right‑size and autoscale to cut idle cost.

<details>
    <summary><b>Google App Engine (2008)</b></summary>

> Mental model: Provide code + config; the platform provisions sandboxes, scales instances on demand, and wires managed services (Datastore, Memcache, Task Queues) without VM management.

- **Technical approach**: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model
- **Developer experience**: Focus on application code, not infrastructure
- **Constraints**: Language/framework restrictions, quotas, managed scaling
- **Impact**: Introduced developers to serverless concepts and auto-scaling
- Architecture and runtimes (early):
  - Sandboxed, opinionated runtimes: initially Python 2.5 → later Java, Go, etc. Limited syscalls and no arbitrary native code.
  - Request model: short request deadlines (initially ~30s), no long-lived background threads; later added Task Queues and Cron for async/offline work.
  - Configuration: app.yaml (handlers, instance class, scaling mode), index.yaml (Datastore composite indexes), cron.yaml, queue.yaml.
- Scaling modes and instances:
  - Automatic, Basic, Manual scaling; “scale to zero” when idle on Automatic.
  - Instance classes (F1/F2/…, memory/CPU buckets). Warmup requests reduce cold-start latency.
  - Versioned deployments; traffic splitting by version (percent or cookie-based) enables canaries/gradual rollouts.
- Built-in services:
  - Datastore (Bigtable-based): entity groups for transactional boundaries; ancestor queries offer strong consistency; non-ancestor queries historically eventual-consistent; later options improved consistency.
  - Task Queues, Cron, Memcache API, Users API, Images, Mail, URLFetch (egress HTTP(S)).
- Storage and persistence:
  - Blobstore (early) for large objects; later Cloud Storage integration. Strong vs eventual consistency trade-offs documented.
  - Logs and metrics surfaced via Admin Console; per-app quotas and budgets to avoid noisy-neighbor and runaway costs.
- Networking and security:
  - Outbound HTTP(S) via URLFetch proxy; inbound is HTTP(S) via Google frontends with load balancing and SSL termination.
  - App identity/service accounts for calling Google APIs; access control via project IAM as the platform evolved.
- Developer workflow: Declarative configs + gcloud tooling; zero-manage infra (no servers to patch). Vendor lock-in mitigated over time with portable APIs and later 2nd-gen runtimes.
- Lasting impact: Popularized autoscale, managed services, traffic-splitting, and minimal ops for web apps—precursors to modern serverless patterns.

  - Load Balancers (Basic/Standard), Application Gateway (L7), Azure Firewall, Front Door, Private Link/Endpoints, VNet Peering, ExpressRoute.
  - DNS: private/public zones; Service Endpoints (optimized service access) and Private Link (private data-plane).
- Compute and storage:
  - VMs with availability sets and zones; VM Scale Sets (VMSS) for homogeneous pools; extensions (Custom Script, agents).
  - Managed Disks (Standard/Premium; LRS/ZRS) and Storage accounts with replication options (LRS/ZRS/GRS/GZRS/RAGRS).

> Mental model: “Image layers + CoW FS (Copy-on-Write Filesystem) + kernel isolation.” <br/>
> Containerd pulls content‑addressed layers, runc starts a namespaced process, cgroups enforce limits, overlay2 gives a writable view. <br/>
> Files Share base data until modified; on write, new blocks are created. In Docker, overlay2 uses CoW layers. <br/>

- **Founder**: Solomon Hykes (demonstrated at PyCon 2013)
- **Technical foundations**: Linux namespaces, cgroups, overlayfs
- **Key innovations**: Standard image format, portable runtime, layered filesystem
- **Impact**: Transformed application packaging, testing, and deployment
- Foundations and runtime:
  - Kernel features: namespaces (PID:Process ID, MNT:Mount, NET:Network, UTS:UNIX Time‑Sharing, IPC:Inter‑Process Communication, user), cgroups v1/v2 (Control Groups) for CPU (Central Processing Unit)/mem (memory)/I/O (Input/Output), capabilities; seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) + AppArmor (Application Armor)/SELinux (Security‑Enhanced Linux) profiles.
  - Union/CoW (Copy‑on‑Write) filesystems: overlay2 (common), also Btrfs (B‑tree File System)/ZFS (Zettabyte File System); copy‑on‑write layers minimize disk and speed deploys.
  - OCI (Open Container Initiative) stack: image spec + runtime spec; containerd (daemon), runc (low‑level runtime), shim isolates container lifecycles from dockerd restarts.
  - Image distribution: content‑addressable (SHA‑256 digests), manifest lists for multi‑arch (multiple CPU architectures); Registry v2 API, layer dedupe and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) range pulls.
- Build and packaging:
  - BuildKit: parallel graph builds, cache mounts, secrets, inline build cache; multi‑stage Dockerfiles trim final images.
  - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)/attestations: build provenance (e.g., SLSA:Supply‑chain Levels for Software Artifacts) and image signing; reproducible builds with pinned bases.
- Networking and storage:
  - Drivers: bridge (default), host, none, macvlan/ipvlan; overlay (VXLAN:Virtual eXtensible LAN) for multi‑host (Swarm/libnetwork).
  - Volumes vs bind mounts; tmpfs (temporary in‑memory FS) for in‑memory; logging drivers (json‑file:JavaScript Object Notation, fluentd, GELF:Graylog Extended Log Format).
- Security and ops:
  - Rootless mode, userns‑remap (user‑namespace remap), least‑privileged capability sets; read‑only rootfs (root filesystem), seccomp default profile.
  - Resource limits: CPU quota/period, cpusets, memory/oom_score_adj (Out‑Of‑Memory score adjust); healthchecks for orchestration readiness.
- Orchestration tie‑ins: CRI (Container Runtime Interface) integration for Kubernetes via containerd; image pull/policy, liveness/readiness/startup probes.

> Reconciliation loops are the core: controllers continuously compute diff(actual, desired) and take minimal actions to converge, making the system self‑healing.

- **Origins**: Inspired by Google’s internal Borg system
- **Key contributors**: Craig McLuckie, Joe Beda, Brendan Burns
- **Technical architecture**: Declarative API, control loops, extensibility via CRDs
- **Core concepts**: Pods, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets
- Control plane and API (Application Programming Interface):
  - kube‑apiserver (front door, authentication/authorization, admission), etcd (strongly consistent KV:Key/Value store), kube‑scheduler (bin‑packing with scoring), controller‑manager (built‑in controllers), optional cloud‑controller‑manager.
  - Declarative model: Group/Version/Resource; desired state in objects; controllers reconcile until observed ≈ desired; finalizers/ownerReferences for lifecycles.
  - Extensibility: CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), admission webhooks, aggregated APIs; Operators encode domain logic atop CRDs.
- Node and data planes
  - kubelet (pod lifecycle), container runtime via CRI (containerd/CRI‑O), CNI (Container Network Interface) for networking, CSI (Container Storage Interface) for storage.

- **Technical approach**: Workload placement based on real-time grid carbon intensity
- **Company commitments**: Microsoft, Google, Amazon announced carbon reduction goals
- **Implementation**: APIs for carbon intensity, scheduler plugins, policy engines
- **Impact**: Shifting flexible workloads to times of abundant renewable energy

- Signals and metrics:
  - Carbon intensity (gCO₂/kWh: grams CO₂ per kilowatt-hour): average vs marginal; forecasts (24–72h) and real-time feeds by region/zone.
  - Combine with PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness), and energy price to form a multi-objective score.
- Workload classes:
  - Deferrable (batch/ETL/ML training), geo-movable (stateless jobs), and latency-critical (pin, optimize rather than move).
  - SLOs (Service Level Objectives) define what can be delayed or relocated without breaching latency/availability.
- Scheduling patterns:
  - Time shifting: cron windows aligned to low-carbon forecast bands; backoff and catch-up windows.
  - Geo shifting: weighted queues or schedulers prefer cleaner regions; fallbacks when capacity or data-residency blocks moves.
  - Admission control: policy engines gate non-urgent starts when carbon score is high.
- Platform integration:
  - Kubernetes: custom scheduler plugins, HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) with external carbon metrics, KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event-Driven Autoscaling) pause/resume.
  - Queues: priority tiers (critical/standard/background) with carbon-aware dispatchers.
  - CI/CD: carbon windows for non-urgent build/test; artifact promotion decoupled from deploy.
- Data sources and governance:
  - Grid APIs (forecast + realtime), internal telemetry, and cloud region signals; cache and smooth noisy signals.
  - Budgets: kgCO₂e (kilograms CO₂-equivalent) per team/service; dashboards and alerts; exception process for critical incidents.
- Risks and safeguards:
  - Don’t violate data residency/compliance; validate capacity and failover paths.
  - Avoid “rebound” effects (extra retries); measure net CO₂e delta versus baseline.

## Recommended Approaches and Best Practices

> In Azure, service/capacity limitations in certain regions are common, especially for high-demand resources (like GPUs, large VM sizes, or new services).

> By monitoring quotas, planning for multi-region deployment, optimizing usage, you can minimize disruption from regional Azure capacity constraints, while meeting energy and sustainability goals.

### Monitor and Request Quota Increases

- Regularly monitor quotas: Use the Azure Portal `Usage + quotas` (per Subscription/Region/Provider) and service blades (e.g., vCPU—virtual CPU families).
- Proactively request increases: Submit quota increases ahead of scale events; some are self‑serve, others require support.
- Automate monitoring: Script checks and alerts for thresholds.
- What to monitor (examples):
  - Compute vCPU families (Dv5, Fsv2, ND/NC GPU families), Public/Static IPs, disk SKUs, vNet Gateways (per region).
  - AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) underlying VM quotas (node pools map to VM families/regions).
- CLI/PowerShell quick checks (Windows PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  # vCPU usage/limits for a region
  az vm list-usage -l eastus -o table

  # Unattached Public IPs (proxy for capacity housekeeping)
  az network public-ip list -g MyRg --query "[?ipConfiguration==null]" -o table

  # Regions list
  az account list-locations --query "[].{name:name, displayName:displayName}" -o table
  ```
- Quota change request:
  - Portal: Subscription > Usage + quotas > Microsoft.Compute (or service) > Region > Request increase.
  - Support ticket (CLI)
    ```powershell
    az extension add --name support
    az support ticket create `
      --problem-classification "Service and subscription limits (quotas)" `
      --service-id "Microsoft.Compute" `
      --title "Increase Dv5 vCPU quota in East US" `
      --severity minimal `
      --description "Need +500 vCPU for AKS scale event in 3 weeks"
    ```

- Alerting pattern: Schedule a task (Windows Task Scheduler/Azure Automation) that pages if usage/limit > 80%.

### Multi-Region Planning

- Architect for portability: Parameterize region/zone in ARM (Azure Resource Manager), Bicep, or Terraform; avoid hard‑coding.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): One template, multiple parameter files for primary/secondary; validate with what‑if.
- Data replication:
  - Storage: LRS → ZRS → GRS/RAGRS/GZRS (pick per RPO/RTO).
  - Azure SQL: Auto‑Failover Groups.
  - Cosmos DB: Multi‑region writes; pick consistency (eventual → strong).
  - Key Vault: Zone‑redundant vaults, soft‑delete, purge protection.
- Routing and failover:
  - Azure Front Door (global L7) or Traffic Manager (DNS) for active/active or active/passive; health probes drive failover.
  - DNS (Domain Name System) TTL tuning for faster cutover.
- Region‑parameterized Bicep:
  ```bicep
  // Deploy a VM Scale Set; pass -p region=eastus|westus2 on deploy
  @allowed([
    'eastus'
    'westus2'
    'westeurope'
  ])
  param region string = resourceGroup().location

  resource vmss 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2023-09-01' = {
    name: 'fleet'
    location: region
    sku: {
      name: 'Standard_D4s_v5'
      capacity: 3
      tier: 'Standard'
    }
    properties: {
      upgradePolicy: { mode: 'Rolling' }
      // ...other properties...
    }
  }
  ```
- What‑if to verify drift/impact:
  ```powershell
  az deployment group what-if -g MyRg -f main.bicep -p region=westus2
  ```

### Leverage Newer/Alternative Regions

- Check capacity in alternatives: Newer/less‑used regions can have more GPU/large VM stock.
- Evaluate constraints: Latency, data residency, compliance, AZ (Availability Zone) count, price/SLA.
- Practical steps:
  - Maintain a ranked “preferred regions” list per workload (latency‑critical vs batch).
  - Measure latency to users/backends:
    ```powershell
    az network watcher test-connectivity `
      --source-resource <vmIdOrName> `
      --dest-address myapp.contoso.com --dest-port 443
    ```
  - Keep equivalency maps of VM SKUs by region (families differ regionally).

- Cost/feature checks: Compare regional pricing and SLAs; validate managed service feature parity before moving.

### Right-Size and Optimize Consumption

- Use autoscaling and Spot VMs (Virtual Machine Scale Sets—VMSS):
  ```powershell
  az vmss create -g MyRg -n batch-spot `
    --image UbuntuLTS --orchestration-mode Uniform `
    --priority Spot --max-price -1 --instance-count 0
  ```
- Deallocate unused resources:
  ```powershell
  # Stop/deallocate
  az vm deallocate -g MyRg -n DevVm01

  # Find and clean up unattached disks
  az disk list --query "[?managedBy==null].{name:name, rg:resourceGroup}" -o table
  ```
- Schedule non‑critical work: Run batch at off‑peak times/regions (AKS CronJobs, Functions timers, Logic Apps).
- Instance/disk optimization: Size VMs to actual CPU/mem/IO; use Ephemeral OS disks for stateless nodes; choose Premium SSD v2/Ultra only where needed.
- Purchasing options: Reservations/Savings Plans for steady workloads; track with Cost Management + Advisor.


### Work with Azure Support

- Engage Microsoft early: For large GPU (AI/ML) clusters or bursts, loop in your account team; consider capacity reservations.
- Capacity reservations (pin capacity):
  ```powershell
  az capacity reservation group create -g MyRg -n capGroup -l eastus
  az capacity reservation create -g MyRg --reservation-group capGroup `
    -n capDv5 --sku "Standard_D8s_v5" --capacity 50 --zone 1
  ```

- Monitor advisories: Azure Service Health alerts for regional constraints/maintenance.
- Open a support ticket (CLI):
  ```powershell
  az support ticket create `
    --problem-classification "Service and subscription limits (quotas)" `
    --service-id "Microsoft.Compute" `
    --title "GPU quota & capacity planning - East US & West Europe" `
    --severity moderate `
    --description "Requesting NDv5 vGPU quota + capacity reservation for Q4 training."
  ```
### Adopt Carbon- and Cost-Aware Scheduling

- Use carbon/cost‑aware strategies: Prefer regions/times with lower carbon intensity or price for deferrable jobs.
- Automate with orchestrators: AKS scheduler plugins, external metrics; Functions/Logic Apps for timers.
- Signals and data: Combine grid carbon indicators (gCO₂/kWh) with price/capacity; track kgCO₂e and $/hr in dashboards.
- AKS autoscale and placement:
  ```powershell
  az aks nodepool update -g MyRg -n np1 --cluster-name MyAks `
    --enable-cluster-autoscaler --min-count 1 --max-count 20
  ```
  - Label/taint `green` pools; HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) with external carbon metrics to pause/resume background work.
- Batch/ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) patterns:
  - Time windows aligned to low‑carbon forecasts
  - Bounded retries with DLQs (Dead‑Letter Queues) for safety
- Governance:
  - Budgets/alerts for cost and emissions
  - Documented RTO/RPO when shifting regions/windows

> [!NOTE]
> Quotas, capacity, cost, and carbon are coupled constraints. Make deployments portable (IaC), keep a ranked list of viable regions/SKUs, and wire alerts so you can react before users feel it.
