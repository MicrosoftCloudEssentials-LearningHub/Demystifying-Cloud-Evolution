### Early Computing Era (1801-1843)

> The early computing era established fundamental concepts still used today:
>  - Program storage separate from computation mechanism
>  - The notion of a general-purpose machine that can be programmed for different tasks
>  - Separation of data and instructions
>  - Sequential execution of operations

<details>
  <summary><b>Jacquard Loom (1801)</b></summary>

> Introduced a system of `punched cards` to control the weaving of complex textile patterns. Each card represented a row of the design, and holes in the card determined which warp threads were lifted.  

- **Joseph Marie Jacquard**: Created programmable textile looms that revolutionized the silk industry
- **Technical significance**: Demonstrated storing instructions as physical media; inspired later computing pioneers
  - **Binary Encoding**: Presence or absence of a hole acted as a binary signal (on/off), a precursor to digital logic.
  - **Sequential Control**: Cards were fed in sequence, allowing the loom to execute a stored program of instructions.
  - **Modularity**: Patterns could be changed by swapping card sets, introducing the concept of **programmability**.
  - **Significance**:
    - Demonstrated **data-driven automation**, instructions stored on physical media rather than hardwired mechanisms.
    - Influenced early computing pioneers like **Charles Babbage**, who adopted the punched card concept for the Analytical Engine.
- **Legacy**: Direct ancestor to punch card computing systems used through the 1970s
  - Direct ancestor of **punch card computing systems** used in tabulating machines (Hollerith, IBM) and early digital computers through the 1970s.
  - Established the principle of **separating hardware from instructions**, foundational for modern computing.
