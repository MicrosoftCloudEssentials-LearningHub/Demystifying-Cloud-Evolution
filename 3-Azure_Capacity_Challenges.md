> Capacity issues in Azure surface in two broad buckets: quota (soft) limits and physical capacity (hard) constraints. Effective designs anticipate both, offer SKU/region flexibility, and automate detection, fallback, and escalation.

## What are Azure Capacity Challenges?

- Soft constraints: subscription/resource quotas (per-VM family cores, public IPs, NICs, vCPU per region, AKS node pools, etc.)
- Hard constraints: regional/AZ scarcity of specific SKUs, ephemeral capacity during incidents, or burst demand (e.g., GPUs)
- Scope: region-level, zone-level, cluster/rack-level, or specific hardware features (e.g., Ultra Disk, GPUs, NVMe)

<details>
<summary><strong>Capacity risk scenarios</strong></summary>

- New region or AZ not yet enabled for a service/SKU
- Hot SKU (e.g., GPUs, Premium SSD v2, Ultra Disk) in short supply
- Highly constrained shapes (large RAM/CPU, confidential computing)
- Scale-out during an incident or global event
- Zonal pinning creating skew (all demand in a single AZ)
- Strict placement policies (PPG/availability sets) limiting allocatable hosts

</details>

## Why capacity constraints happen

- Demand spikes: seasonal events, marketing launches, or incident-induced migrations
- Hardware specialization: GPUs/NPUs or Ultra Disk clusters are finite per region/AZ
- Zonal affinity: all workloads targeting one zone
- Fixed regional envelopes: datacenter lead times vs. sudden growth
- SKU features mismatch: requiring features not present in selected region/zone
- Quota not aligned: per-VM family vCPU not raised ahead of scale

<details>
<summary><strong>Preventable causes and anti-patterns</strong></summary>

- Single-region dependency without failover
- Tightly constrained SKU choices (one exact size) with no fallbacks
- Overuse of proximity placement groups beyond strict latency needs
- Ignoring per-family quotas during IaC rollouts
- Fixed zonal mappings without elasticity
- Manual-only escalation for quota increases

</details>

## Common signals and error codes

- AllocationFailure: The requested VM size/zone/region currently cannot be allocated
- OverconstrainedAllocationRequest / ZonalAllocationFailed: constraints prevent placement
- QuotaExceeded: Subscription or per-VM-family quota insufficient
- OperationNotAllowed: Service limit reached (e.g., IPs, NICs, disks)
- SKUNotAvailable: Size not available in selected region/zone
- InsufficientMemory/InsufficientCores (service-specific messages)

<details>
<summary><strong>How to confirm and triage</strong></summary>

- Check Service Health and Resource Health for regional advisories
- Query Activity Logs for failed deployments and error codes
- Use What-If before large template rollouts to detect quota gaps
- Attempt allocation in alternate zone or region to isolate scope
- Validate SKU availability programmatically

</details>

## Proactive planning and design

- Multi-AZ and multi-region ready: design for N+1 regions with active/active or active/passive
- SKU flexibility: define a prioritized list of sizes per workload class
- Region flexibility: primary/secondary/tertiary region matrix, aligned to data residency
- Zonal elasticity: allow any-of AZs unless strict locality is required
- Quota-as-code: pre-raise quotas in pipelines; track as configuration
- Use scale sets with mixed or flexible orchestration modes
- Reservations/Savings Plans for steady base; burst on-demand
- For GPUs or Ultra Disk: pre-provision warm capacity with health checks

<details>
<summary><strong>Architecture patterns</strong></summary>

- Active/Active with Front Door or Traffic Manager across 2+ paired regions
- VMSS Flexible Orchestration with multiple SKUs in priority order
- AKS multiple node pools with alternative VM sizes and zones
- Stateless app tier and stateful data layer with geo-replication (ZRS/GRS, AG listener, Cosmos DB multi-region)
- Deployment rings: canary → regional → multi-region
- Feature flags to toggle region or SKU at runtime

</details>

## Operational playbooks (runbooks)

- Detect: Monitor allocation failures and quota nearing thresholds
- Decide: Auto-select alternative AZ/SKU/region according to policy
- Do: Retry with relaxed constraints; escalate quota requests automatically
- Document: Log incidents, annotate cost/latency impacts, and update the allowlists

<details>
<summary><strong>Runbook examples</strong></summary>

- VMSS scale-out fails with AllocationFailure → retry with next SKU; if repeat, pick next AZ; if repeat, shift to secondary region
- AKS pending pods due to unschedulable nodes → enable/verify Cluster Autoscaler; add alt-size node pool; temporarily taint/cordon and drain
- QuotaExceeded detected in What-If → programmatically raise per-family quota and block merge until approved
- GPU scarcity → shift batch/training to Batch with low-priority or spot VMs in alternate region; queue jobs

</details>

## Automation examples (CLI/PowerShell/Bicep/KQL)

- List available VM sizes/SKUs by region

```powershell
# PowerShell
Get-AzVMSize -Location eastus | Sort-Object Name | Select-Object -First 10
```

```json
// Bicep (snippet) - VMSS Flexible with multiple SKUs
// Note: illustrative snippet; adapt to your module style
```

```bicep
param location string = resourceGroup().location
param skuPrimary string = 'Standard_D4s_v5'
param skuAlt string = 'Standard_D2s_v5'

resource vmss 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2024-03-01' = {
	name: 'web-flex'
	location: location
	sku: {
		name: skuPrimary
		capacity: 2
	}
	properties: {
		orchestrationMode: 'Flexible'
		upgradePolicy: { mode: 'Rolling' }
		virtualMachineProfile: {
			priorityMixPolicy: {
				baseRegularPriorityCount: 2
			}
			osProfile: {
				computerNamePrefix: 'web'
				adminUsername: 'azureuser'
			}
			storageProfile: {
				imageReference: {
					publisher: 'Canonical'
					offer: '0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy'
					sku: '22_04-lts'
					version: 'latest'
				}
			}
			networkProfile: {
				networkInterfaceConfigurations: [
					{
						name: 'nic'
						properties: {
							primary: true
							ipConfigurations: [{ name: 'ipconfig' }]
						}
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}

// Alternate SKU VM resource to join VMSS Flex as instance
resource vmAlt 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2024-03-01' = {
	name: 'web-alt-001'
	location: location
	properties: {
		virtualMachineScaleSet: {
			id: vmss.id
		}
		hardwareProfile: {
			vmSize: skuAlt
		}
		storageProfile: {
			imageReference: {
				publisher: 'Canonical'
				offer: '0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy'
				sku: '22_04-lts'
				version: 'latest'
			}
		}
		osProfile: {
			computerName: 'web-alt-001'
			adminUsername: 'azureuser'
			linuxConfiguration: { disablePasswordAuthentication: true }
		}
		networkProfile: {
			networkInterfaces: [
				{
					id: resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces', 'nic-web-alt-001')
					properties: { primary: true }
				}
			]
		}
	}
}
```

- Query allocation failures and quotas in Activity Logs and Azure Monitor

```kql
// Activity Logs: VM allocation failures last 24h
AzureActivity
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where OperationNameValue has 'write' and ActivityStatusValue == 'Failed'
| where Properties has_any ('AllocationFailure','Overconstrained','SKUNotAvailable','QuotaExceeded')
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceGroup, Resource, OperationNameValue, ActivityStatusValue, Properties
```

- Programmatically request quota increases

```powershell
# Example: Increase vCPU per-VM family quota
# Note: Use Az.Quota cmdlets when available in your environment
# Fallback to Azure Portal or REST API for specific providers if needed
```

- Validate SKU availability via CLI

```powershell
# Azure CLI in PowerShell shell
az vm list-skus --location eastus --output table | Select-String D4s_v5
```

## AKS- and PaaS-specific guidance

- AKS
	- Multiple node pools with different VM sizes and zones
	- Use Cluster Autoscaler and Pod PriorityClasses for critical workloads
	- Consider virtual nodes (ACI) for burst
	- Pre-pull container images to reduce cold-start contention
	- For GPUs, pre-create tainted GPU pools and schedule with tolerations

- App Service / Functions
	- Use multiple worker tiers and regional deployments with Traffic Manager/Front Door
	- For Premium plans, pre-warm instances; use scale-out rules with headroom
	- Consumption plans: plan for throttling and cold starts; consider Premium for predictability

- Databases
	- For SQL MI or Hyperscale, plan capacity with HA/DR replicas in paired regions
	- Use ZRS/GRS storage where applicable; monitor IO caps

## Testing, drill, and validation

- Pre-deployment What-If on all IaC changes
- Chaos/scale drills that simulate regional or AZ scarcity
- Blue/green or canary across regions to validate fallback
- Regularly rehearse quota raise workflows and SLAs
- Maintain a sandbox subscription for destructive allocation tests

## Cost, reservations, and risk trade-offs

- Reservations for base capacity (commitment vs. flexibility)
- Savings Plans for broader compute coverage
- Premium SKUs vs. Standard with caching and scale-out
- Cross-region data egress vs. availability objectives
- Spot/low-priority for non-critical batch

## Checklist

- Defined primary and secondary regions with tested failover
- SKU fallback list encoded in IaC
- Quota thresholds monitored and auto-escalated
- What-If and SKU availability checks in CI
- VMSS/AKS configured for flexible placement
- Incident runbooks documented and exercised
